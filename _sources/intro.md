# Concreto Reforzado I

The concrete is the material that is most used in the construction of buildings, bridges, roads, etc. It is a material that is easy to handle, resistant, durable, and economical. The concrete is a mixture of cement, water, and aggregates (sand, gravel, or crushed stone). The cement is the binding material that holds the aggregates together. The water is used to hydrate the cement and make it harden. The aggregates are used to give the concrete its strength and durability.
